* Begin with the soup. Cover the bones and feet in water and bring to the boil. After 5 minutes, drain the water and rinse the bones. Cover the bones with fresh water and bring to the boil again. Simmer for 4 hours, topping up water if it gets low. After 4 hours, add the aromatics to the soup and simmer for another hour or so.  
* To make the chashu, trim the pork belly and tie in a roll. Place into a pot, cover with cold water and bring it to a boil for a few minutes. Then remove the water, rinse the pork and then add more cold water to cover the pork again, along with the kombu and mushrooms. Bring it slowly to a boil before removing the kombu and adding the sugar and ginger. Set it to simmer and add a cartouche.
* After an hour, add the remaining chashu ingredients and simmer for another hour. Remove the pork from the braising liquid and chill the meat and the braising liquid. Use the liquid for ramen eggs (ajitama).
* For the tare, combine all the ingedients and mix well.
* To assemble place the tare in the bottom of each bowl, add the soup, noodles and chashu, along with other toppings (ramen eggs, nori, spring onion, katsuobushi etc.) and oils.
