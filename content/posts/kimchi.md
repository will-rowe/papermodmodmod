* Start by combining the salt and water from the kimchi ingredients. Half the cabbage down the length and soak for an hour in the brine. When done, remove and rinse it to remove the excess salt.
* Combine all the paste ingredients together and blend until smooth.
* Rough chop the chives.
* Spread the paste between the cabbage leaves, adding in chives as you go. When done, spread the remaining paste on the outside of the cabbages. Then place the cabbage in your fermentation crock, pressing the seal down to the level of the cabbage.
* Leave on the counter for a two days to kick start the fermentation, then place in the fridge for a couple of weeks minimumn. After this, you can pick out of the crock as you need or divide the lot up into smaller mason jars.
