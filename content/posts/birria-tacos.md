* Toast the cumin and coriander seeds in a cast iron pan util fragrant, then grind to a fine powder.
* Simmer the chilies, tomatoes, onion, garlic in enough boiling water to cover them. After 20 minutes, blend to a smooth paste, loosening with water as needed.
* Sear the beef in the pan and then add the paste, spices, salt and pepper. Add the stock and top up with water to cover. Bring to a simmer, add a cartouche and then place in the oven for 4 hours at 120Â°C. Shred the beef when cooked.
* When you are ready with the masa tortillas, dip them in the cooking liquid and cook them in a cast iron skillet, adding the beef, cheese and corriander and lime. Serve with a salsa.
