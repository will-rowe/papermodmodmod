* The night before you want waffles, combine the sourdough discard with the milk and flour. This will form a sponge overnight.
* On waffles morning, separate the egg whites from the egg yolks and beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.
* To the egg yolks, add the remaining ingredients and whisk until a smooth mixture forms.
* Fold egg yolk mixture into the sponge, and then fold the egg whites in as well until everything is combined.
* Melt some butter or spray some oil onto the waffle iron and pour on the recommended amount of mixture for your waffle iron.
* If you have a flipping waffle iron, cook on one side for 30 seconds before flipping and cooking for another 3 minutes or so, until the waffle is golden brown.
