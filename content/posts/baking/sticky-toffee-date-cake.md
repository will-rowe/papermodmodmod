* Remove the stones from the dates, add to the water and bring to a simmer for 5 minutes. Blend to a puree and add the vanilla and spices.
* Cream the butter and sugars, then add the eggs and whisk until fluffy.
* Add the date puree and mix to combine.
* Mix the flours, baking powder and salt in a separate bowl and then gradually fold into the wet mix.
* Pour the batter into a greased bundt tin and cook in the oven at 160Â°C for 45 minutes until a skewer is removed cleanly from the cake.
* Let the cake completely cool before removing from the tin.
* For the salted caramel, combine all the ingredients in a pan and heat slowly, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Increase the heat until the sauce bubbles, then cook until the sauce is a syrupy consistency.
* Top the cake with the caramel and some finely sliced dates.
