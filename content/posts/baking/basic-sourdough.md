notes: [
    "Use bread flour with at least 13% protein content.",
    "Try to maintain the dough at 20-25째C during bulk rise. If you can use [a proofing box](https://www.lakeland.co.uk/63493/Brod-&-Taylor-Folding-Bread-Proofer-&-Slow-Cooker-FP-205?src=gfeed&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds), or as a cheaper alternative you can improvise with [a heat mat](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07Y5WPF7W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).",
    "I've found that you can get away with less kneading / not much at all, as long as you get enough stretch and folds in.",
    "If the starter isn't particularly active, try making it a bit thicker for a few days (less water / more flour), this will prioritise the yeast growth over the bacteria (reference needed...). This may also reduce the sour-ness of the bread if you find it is a little too sour."

* Make the [levain](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/what-is-a-levain-and-how-is-it-different-from-a-starter/) the night before you want to make the bread. Combine the flour, water and sour dough starter in a clear container and keep on the counter overnight. The levain is ready when it has doubled in size or when a small amount will float in water.
* To start making the bread combine the flours and water in a large bowl, reserving the extra water for later. Just mix until all the flour is hyrdrated, then cover with a towel and leave for at least 1 hour. This is the `autolyse step`.
* Once the autolyse is complete, add the levain to the top of the flour and combine using the [Rubaud knead](https://youtu.be/pxPxoUagD3I). Leave the dough for 15 minutes to let fermentation start and for the dough to relax a bit.
* Dissolve the salt in the extra water, then add this to the dough and combine using the [Rubaud knead](https://youtu.be/pxPxoUagD3I). Leave the dough to relax for 5 minutes.
* Turn the dough out on to a counter and form a smooth dough by slap and folding for 2-5 minutes. Stop if you see any tears happening. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with a towel and leave to rest. This is the start of the `bulk rise step`.
* During the first 2 hours of the bulk rise, stretch and fold the dough every 20 minutes or so. No folds are needed after 2 hours, just leave the dough until it has increased in size by about 20-30% and you can begin to see some air pockets appearing on the surface. The bulk rise should take between 3-4 hours in total in a 19-22째C environment.
* After the bulk rise has completed, turn the dough onto the counter and leave for 2 minutes before giving it a `preshape` and then resting for 10 minutes.
* Apply some flour and give the dough a `final shaping` before dusting with rice flour and placing in the banneton, covering with a towel and leaving in the fridge overnight for the `final proof`.
* The next morning pre-heat a dutch oven or combi cooker in the oven at 230째C.
* Remove the combi cooker from the oven, turn the loaf from the banneton onto base of the combi cooker and dust with some more rice flour.
* Using a razor blade, score the length of the dough 2cm from the middle. Make sure to cut at a 90째 angle and only about 0.5cm deep (go deeper if using a lower hydration dough).
* Give the inside of the combi cooker a few mists of water and then cover the lid over the base.
* Cook in the oven for 20 minutes, remove the lid and then cook for a further minutes or until the crust is the desired colour.
