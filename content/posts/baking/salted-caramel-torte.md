* Melt the chocolate in a glass bowl over a pan of boiling water.
* Whilst the chocolate is melting, whisk the eggs and sugar until fluffy and approximately doubled in size.
* Melt the butter and combine with the melted chocolate, along with a pinch of salt.
* Let the chocolate mixture cool while you grease and line a 25cm cake tin, then fold the chocolate into the eggs, before pouring into the tin.
* Cook in a bain marie in the oven at 120Â°C until a skewer comes out clean and the centre of the cake only slightly wobbles. Around 40 mintues.
* For the salted caramel, combine all the ingredients in a pan and heat slowly, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Increase the heat until the sauce bubbles, then cook until the sauce is a syrupy consistency.
