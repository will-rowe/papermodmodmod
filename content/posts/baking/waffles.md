* Preheat the waffle iron
* Separate the egg whites from the egg yolks and beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.
* To the egg yolks, add the remaining ingredients (apart from the bacon!) and whisk until a smooth mixture forms.
* Fold the egg whites into the mixture until combined and then place in a jug.
* Melt some butter or spray some oil onto the waffle iron and pour on the recommended amount of mixture for your waffle iron.
* If you have a flipping waffle iron, cook on one side for 30 seconds before flipping and cooking for another 3 minutes or so, until the waffle is golden brown.
* Arrange waffle quarters, bacon and blueberries in the style of a butterfly and cover in maple syrup or honey
