* Separate the egg whites from the egg yolks and beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.
* To the egg yolks, add the remaining ingredients and whisk until a smooth mixture forms.
* Fold the egg whites into the mixture until combined and then place in a jug.
* Melt some butter on a plancha and pour the mixture slowly to form 10cm wide pancakes.
* Cook on one side until bubbles form and then flip, cooking on the other side until golden brown.
* Serve in a stack with sliced fruit and maple syrup.
