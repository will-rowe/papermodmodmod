* For the cheesecake, begin by beating the cheese and sugar until smooth.
* Whisk the eggs separately until soft peaks form, then fold into the cheese mix, along with the vanilla, cream and a small pinch of salt.
* Grease a small loaf tin with some butter and line with baking paper; grease the paper as well.
* Pour the mix into the tin, tap it on the counter a few times to settle it, then place in the oven at 220Â°C for 40 minutes until there is a slight wobble in the centre and the exterior has the characteristic burnt look.
* Cool the cheesecake on a rack and then fridge it for at least a couple of hours.
* To make the sauce, combine the sugar and berries in a pan and cook at a low temperature for half an hour until the berries have broken down. Pass through a sieve to remove the seeds and put back on the heat. Add the zest and half the juice of a lemon, as well as finely sliced mint leaves. For a glossier sauce, add a small bit of butter.
