* Activate the yeast by stirring into the warmed milk and leaving for 5 minutes.
* Cream the butter and eggs. Combine with the milk and yeast. Add the salt and then gradually add the flour whilst mixing using a dough hook and standmixer.
* When the dough is smooth and well kneaded (this can be finished by hand if required), add it to a greased bowl and leave to proove until doubled in size.
* Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a 1cm thick sheet and cut out the doughnuts. Cut out the centres too and keep these as well.
* Cover the dougnuts and let rise for another 30 minutes.
* Fry the doughnuts in a cast iron pot, flipping them over when the bottom side is golden brown and cooking the other side to the same colour.
* Cool on a rack and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
