* Start with the lemon curd glaze so it has time to cool fully. Whisk the lemon juice and zest, sugar and eggs to combine. Add this to a pan and warm over low heat gradually, adding in the melted butter whilst whisking constantly. Remove from heat when the mixture coats the back of a spoon. Let the lemon curd cool, stirring intermittently so it doesn't go lumpy.
* For the buttery biscuit base, melt the butter in a pan and add the syrup. Whilst this is happening, blitz the gingerbread in a blender (or mash in a pestle and mortar) and then combine with the melted butter mix.
* Press the biscuit mixture into a greased 20cm springform cake tin (line the bottom with greaseproof paper if you want to be safe).
* Bake the buttery biscuit base for 10 minutes at 160°C, then cool on a wire rack.
* To make the filling, start by beating the mascarpone and cream cheese in a mixer until smooth and then add the sugar and flour whilst continuing to mix.
* Whilst still mixing, add the vanilla extract and the lemon juice and zest.
* Add the eggs and then pour in the creme fraiche. Stop mixing once combined - don't over-beat.
* Re-grease the sides of the tin and add the filling.
* Put back in the oven at 160°C for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 90°C and bake for about 40 minutes. Turn the oven off when the top of the cake gives a slight wobble when you shake it. Leave it in the oven for a couple of hours until cool.
* Add the lemon curd glaze to the top of the cake and then let set fully in the fridge.
