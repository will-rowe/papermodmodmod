* Whisk to combine the milk, eggs, sugar, salt, vanilla and spices. Zest the lemon into the custard mix.
* Soak the slices of bread in the custard mix for 5 minutes before cooking.
* Using one tablespoon of butter per slice of bread, cook each piece on one side using a medium high heat. Add leftover custard to the sourdough holes as the bread cooks (best done once a seal has formed on the base). When the bottom side is golden brown, flip and cook the other side.
* Serve with blueberries, crispy bacon and maple syrup.
