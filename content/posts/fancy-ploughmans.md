    "I've used a moon cake mould to make the pies, you can use other moulds or freestyle it (if doing this, you can chill the uncovered pie for 30 minutes or so before adding the filling and lid.",
    "There will be some extra pastry - use this to plug holes that appear after you have pressed the pies, then re-press them",
    "Try doing the pickles in a fermenation crock",

* The pickles can be made in advance and kept in the fridge. Disolve the sugar and salt in the vinegar. Push the cucumbers vertically into a mason jar or similar. Pour in the vinegar and add the spices and all other ingredients except the water. Boil the water and then pour into the jar so that the cucumbers are covered by fluid. Add more water if necessary. Seal and give the jar a few turns to make sure everything is distributed. Loosen the lid of slightly.
* For the British pie pastry, start by adding the rosemary and water to a pan and heat it until boiling. Whilst the water is on, combine the flour and salt. Remove the rosemary and add the butter and beef dripping to the boiling water. When everything is liquid, pour the mix onto the flour and then stir to combine. Crack in the two eggs and knead briefly to bring the pastry together. Wrap in clingfilm, let cool and then put in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
* Whilst the pie pastry is chilling, combine the British pie filling ingredients and divide into 40g balls.
* Remove the pastry and divide into 60g balls (there will be some extra, this is for plugging holes later).
* Roll out each pastry ball into a 0.5cm thick disk, put a ball of filling in the middle and then draw the pastry over the ball and loosely press down.
* Flip the ball over so that the seal is on the counter, then put the mooncake mould over the ball and press down to get the desired moulding. Place the pies on a lined backing sheet, then use a cocktail stick to make a small whole on the top of the pie.
* Place in a pre-heated oven at 180Â°C. After 10 minutes remove and give them an egg or milk wash, then put them back in for a further 30 minutes or until they are a dark brown.
* Cool on a rack and make up the stock and gelatine combo.
* Once the pies are cool and the gelatine is cool and gloopy, use a syringe or pipeing bag to put a bit of jelly in each pie. Chill in the fridge.
* For the jam, start by thinly slicing an onion and adding it to a hot pan with the oil, butter and salt. Cook over a really low heat, stirring occasionally and letting the onions caramalise. This should take at least 20 minutes.
* Add the brown sugar and cook until sticky, then add the vinegar and let the fluid boil off.
* Add the tomato paste and water, stirring and bring back up to a simmer. Let simmer for 5 minutes and then put in a blender if a smooth jam is wanted.
* Strain the blended mix back into the pan, cook to reduce until the right consistency and then bottle it up.
