* Place the beans and bicarbonate of soda in a saucepan, cover in water and leave overnight.
* The next day, cook the beans over low heat for 1 - 2 hours, stirring often to prevent sticking. Top up water as necessary.
* Add diced onion, garlic and salt before cooking for another 15 - 20 minutes.
* Blend mixture to a smooth consistency, adding water if necessary.
* Fry the beans in a little oil for 15 minutes, stirring continuously until the texture resembles mashed potato.
* Allow to cool and then form a log on a serving platter and leave to chill in the fridge.
* Serve with tortilla, salsa and goats cheese.
