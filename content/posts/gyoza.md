* For the filling, begin by removing some of the water from the cabbage by salting, leaving to rest 20 minutes before rinsing and drying.
* Shred the cabbage, dice the mushroom, corriander and spring onion, and mince the garlic and ginger.
* Comine all the filling ingredients together and mix thoroughly.
* For the dough, add the oil and salt to the just boiled water. Gradually incorporate the water into the flour and form the dough. Roll the dough out into a long log and leave to rest for 30 minutes.
* Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces, roll them into discs and dust each side with cornflour.
* To make the dipping sauce combine the soy sauce and vinegar with the ginger, which has been finely julienned.
* [Wrap the gyoza](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-wrap-gyoza/) and then cook by placing the flat side of the gyoza in frying pan with a shallow layer of oil. Once the underside is golden brown, half cover the gyoza in boiling water, put a lid on the pan and steam until cooked. If you want to get fancy, add a cornflour slurry at the end to form a lattice around the gyoza.
