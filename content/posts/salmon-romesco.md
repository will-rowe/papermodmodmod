* For the romesco sauce, roughly chop the peppers and onion, then toss them with the garlic, nuts, and thyme in the paprika with some salt, pepper and olive oil. Roast for 25 minutes at 170Â°C.
* Blend the roasted veg and nuts with the stock and vinegar. Add the butter and continue to blend until velvety, adding some water if it needs loosening. Adjust the seasoning now.
* You can serve this with some salmon and vegetables, or as a pasta sauce. I like making a cougette and parmesan twist, along with some roasted sweet potato.
