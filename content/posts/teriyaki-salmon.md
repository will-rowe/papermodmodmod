* To make the rice, cook the wild rice following the package instructions. Whilst cooking, saute the mushrooms and add the garlic. In a bowl add the butter, juice and zest of the lemon and finely chopped coriander. Put the warm rice on top, along with the mushrooms. After leaving for a few minutes for the butter to melt, stir the rice thoroughly.
* For the mayo, use the stick blender method to make a basic mayo with the egg and oil. Then mince the garlic, add salt and continue to form a paste. Add the garlic paste, sriracha, lemon juice and creme fraiche to the mayo, gently combine and adjust seasoning.
* For the miso glaze, mince the garlic and combine all the ingredients. Cook the salmon skin side down in a hot skillet with a little oil. Apply the glaze to the flesh as it cooks.
* To serve, char grill some pak choi and serve the salmon and rice with the mayo and toasted sesame seeds.
