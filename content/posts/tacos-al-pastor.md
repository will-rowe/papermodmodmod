* Toast the cumin and guajillo chillies in a hot pan. Rehydrate the guajillo chillies in hot water and grind the cumin to a powder.
* Blend the guajillo chillies, ancho chillies, cumin, cinnamon, salt, vinegar, sugar, garlic and juice from the pineapple tin (save the pinapple for a salsa). Loosen with water if needed so that the mixture can be spread over the pork easily.
* Cut the pork into 1cm slices and rub in the marinade. Leave in the fridge overnight.
* The next day push the slices onto skewers, pushing the meat together so that they are packed on.
* Smoke the skewers for 2 hours at 100°C and then finish off by grilling to get a nice char.
* Serve in warmed masa tortillas, along with a pineapple relish (pineapple, jalepeños, sweetcorn, vinegar and a bit of sugar) and corriander.
