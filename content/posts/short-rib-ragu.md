* Brown the short ribs (these should be bone in) in a dutch oven or similar, then set aside.
* Add a few tablespoons of olive oil to the pan and add the diced onions, carrot and celery. Saute until softened and then add the minced garlic and thyme.
* Add the red wine and cook off the alcohol.
* Add the tomato puree and cook for a few minutes.
* Put the short ribs back in the pot, along with the chopped tomatoes, adding water until the meat is covered.
* Place a cartouche and then the lid before putting in the oven at 120Â°C for at least 4 hours, removing once the meat is very tender.
* Remove the meat, add the parmesan to the pan and check seasoning. Blend the sauce until smooth.
* Pull the meat from the bones, shred it and add it to the sauce.
* Serve on pasta with basil, pepper and more parmesan.
