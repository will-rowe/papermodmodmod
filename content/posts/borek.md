* Combined the yoghurt, milk, oil and egg and set aside.
* Dice and saute the onion and garlic. Once soft, add the hazlenuts, shredded kale, chiffonade mint and stock.
* When the stock has reduced, crumble in cubes of feta and turn of the heat.
* Brush the yoghurt mixture on a sheet of phyllo and add another sheet over the top. Repeat until you have 4 sheets stacked and washed with yoghurt. Add 1/3 of the filling along the top side of the rectangle and then roll until you have a filled cylinder of pastry.
* Transfer the cyclinder to a baking sheet and coil it on itself so that you have a swirl.
* Repeat and continue forming the swirl with the two additional cyclanders.
* Brush the remaining yoghurt mixture on the swirl and then bake in the oven until golden brown, around 20 minutes at 170°C.
