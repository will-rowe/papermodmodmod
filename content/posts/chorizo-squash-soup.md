* Cut the squash in half, season it and add the thyme on top, along with some olive oil. Roast at 160Â°C with the carrots until cooked, around 30 minutes.
* Whilst the squash is cooking, cube the chorizo and render the fat by placing in a cold cast iron pan and bringing it up to a medium high heat.
* When the chorizo is crisped up, remove it on to a piece of kitchen towel. Slice the onions and cook them in the chorizo fat. When caramalised, add the garlic and spices, cooking until fragrant.
* Add the stock, bring to a simmer and add the carrot and cooked squash (after removing the skin and seeds).
* Add the coconut milk, blitz the soup until the right consistency and then check seasoning.
* If you want, reheat the chorizo and add some balsamic vinegar. Then when the vinegar has reduced, add a drizel of honey.
* Dish the soup, add the chorizo on top and any other garnishes (e.g. sesame/chili oil, cream, chives etc.).
