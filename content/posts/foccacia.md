* Make the sourdough dough as in the [basic sourdough recipe](/basic-sourdough-bread).
* When the stretch and folds are complete, form a loose ball and arrange in the centre of a greased 20cm x 30cm baking tin.
* Finely slice the garlic, olives and potatoes before tossing in oil with the diced rosemary and salt.
* Once the bulk rise is done (the dough should now fill the baking tin), top with the sliced veg and add more oil on top.
* Bake at 200Â°C for 25 minutes, the potatoes should be cooked and golden brown.
