* Start the pork the night before. Trim the belly and score the fat in a criss cross patern. Pat dry with kitchen towel and rub the salt into the skin. Leave uncovered in the fridge until cooking the next day.
* Rub off any excess salt from the pork, seaon the underside and then put in oven at 170°C for one hour. After the hour has passed, put the oven up to 220°C in the grill plus oven mode. Let the skin bubble up, which should take a few minutes. Careful not to burn it. Let rest for half an hour.
* For the sauce, toast the sesame seeds, mince the garlic and ginger, then combine all the sauce ingredients together, mixing well.
* To make the bao, add the yeast to the warm milk, whisk and wait for 10 minutes. Stir all the bao ingredients together, leave for 10 minutes and then work into a smooth dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for a couple of hours until doubled in size.
* Turn the dough out onto a greased surface and cut out the number of bao servings. Ball them and let them sit for 10 minutes to relax. Cut a square of grease proof paper for each bao. Roll out each ball into an oval shape that is around 0.5cm thick. Put a small bit of peanut oil on the top side of each oval, then fold it in half across the shorter side of the oval so that the oiled side is in the middle. Put each bao on a piece of paper (that should not be much bigger than the half oval). Steam the buns in a steamer basket set for around 8 minutes until white and risen.
* Cut the pork into bitesize chunks and layer in the buns with the sauce. Serve  with [kimchi](/kimchi), sweetened nuts (toast and crush the peanuts with the icing sugar), vegetable batons and corriander.
