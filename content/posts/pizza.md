* Combine the poolish ingredients the night before you wish to have pizza. Stir until a smooth mixture forms. Leave in the bowl under a towel on the bench, or if the room is warm, in the fridge after a couple of hours standing at room temperature.
* The next morning, combine the dough ingredients with the poolish and stir into a shaggy dough. Leave it for 30 minutes before kneading it to a smooth consistency, which will take around 5 to 10 minutes. Place in an oiled bowl and cover. Leave until doubled in size, around 4 hours.
* Divide the dough into the correct number of servings, with each piece weighing around 200 grams for a 10 inch pizza. Form into balls, brush with oil and leave in a proofing box.
* If you are going to be using later in the evening or the following day, place the dough into the fridge, just make sure you give it and hour or so to warm up when you get it out.
* Shape the pizzas, add the sauce, then parmesan, toppings and mozerella. Cooking in a preheated pizza oven for a minute or two. Add more parmesan, basil and some oil before eating.
