* Whisk all the wet dough ingredients to combine. Then add to the dry dough ingredients and knead lightly for a few minutes until a smooth dough is formed. Wrap and place in the fridge for at least half an hour.
* Rough chop and combine all the filling ingredients and then form 55g balls.
* Remove the pastry from the fridge and divide into 60g balls; set extra dough aside fot plugging holes.
* Roll out each pastry ball into a 0.5cm thick disk, put a ball of filling in the middle and then draw the pastry over the ball and loosely press down.
* Flip the ball over so that the seal is on the counter, then put the mooncake mould over the ball and press down to get the desired moulding. Place the pies on a lined backing sheet, then use a cocktail stick to make a small whole on the top of the pie. Lightly mist with a bit of water.
* Place in a pre-heated oven at 180Â°C. After 10 minutes remove and give them an egg or milk wash, then put them back in for a further 20 minutes or until they are a dark brown.
