This site is to keep track of recipes that I cook regularly / have cooked more than once.

The instructions are a rough guide and make a few assuptions:

* You are tasting whilst cooking; adjusting the seasoning, acidity etc.
* Knife cut styles etc. are up to you. E.g. brunoise where it says dice if you have time and feel the recipe would be improved from it.
* Use the right fats (oils, butters etc.) for the meal, they aren't always specified in the recipe.

## Website

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is based on the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) template that I have hacked away at with terrible CSS and JS.
